I go through periods where I feel absolutely useless. Everything I try is met with resistance. I look at my to-do list, and it feels empty of purpose. I struggle to get up. I’m wandering around in a fog.

There’s not always a rhyme or reason for it. Sometimes I really failed, or received tough feedback. Other times, I seem to just fall out momentum.

I’ve had plenty of times like these, and it can be slow going to climb my way out. Self-confidence is at the root of my feelings and motivation at work, and it has a _huge_ impact on how I feel.

Over the years I’ve developed a number of tactics to battle the low periods. One I made is an entry in my Notes app called **The Power File**.

What I found is - when I’m feeling great, flying high, great things happen and I completely forget about them. I think it’s part of the human condition - praise and accomplishment get forgotten much faster than emptiness and doubt. When I’m down in the dumps, I can’t remember the last time I succeeded.

So when something good happens, I stash evidence of it in **The Power File**. No rules really. If I receive some praise, I might put it in verbatim, or I might just put a mention of it in. Sometimes I‘ll expand a little on the project in question, try to note anything I learned while doing it. We forget all the hidden ways we grow in our lives.

If I’m having a rough week, or feeling short of expectations, I just pull up the file and do some review. It reminds me what I can accomplish when I’m at my best.

This self-confidence stuff is really powerful. You can’t do really creative, risky things without it. This is part of what works for me.

Here’s the intro paragraph:

> Look, it’s OK. There are gonna be times when you feel less effective, less impactful, less confident. Remember: it’s happened before, and it’s totally normal. Things get bumpy. Think of it as a learning experience and you’ll be through it in no time. Give yourself permission to struggle and recover, and you’ll be up to your old tricks again in no time.
