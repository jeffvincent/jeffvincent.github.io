I watched the `Mars: Inside Space X` documentary from Nat Geo today (Disney+ for the win). I’ve consumed _plenty_ of coverage on Elon Musk and his many accomplishments over the years, so there was no new factual information in the doc.

But there are several moments during the film (~45m) where Elon covers the “why” for his many adventures, and I found that particularly insightful.

Best encapsulation of what really stuck with me is near the end, when he turns to the camera and says (paraphrasing): “Life can’t just be about solving one small problem after another. It’s got to be about pursuing something big, something that motivates you to get out of bed in the morning.”

What Musk absolutely nails is `the power of inspiration to make things happen`.

The doc has interviews with several other space-centric experts, and they all cover the same ground: as a species, we’re at risk if we remain on a single planet. For humanity to survive in the long-run, we need to be multi-planetary.

Ok, that’s a pretty big and inspiring problem to work on, surely.

But Musk looks at it differently. He says (again, paraphrasing): “Sure, if we don’t become multi-planetary, we don’t survive. But what I’m more interested in is actually becoming a space-faring species and figuring out what’s going on in the cosmos.”

In other words: “Survival is cool, but Star Trek fucking rocked.”

Growing businesses is pretty cool, more money and stuff is mostly good. Making customers happy and delivering something of value is cool too. But building something amazing that doesn’t exist yet fucking rocks.  So many people focus on the solving small problems and “unlocking more growth” in the business, as if that’s all we’re there for. But there’s something _truly inspiring_ about building something together with a group of people that is new and different. Even if it doesn’t perform perfectly, even if it isn’t all practical - it’s the adventure and the creation that makes it special.

Does it always work out? No, look at [General Magic](https://www.generalmagicthemovie.com/). But that’s still more inspiring, more worthy of our time on the planet than tuning a widget to squeeze out a little more growth.

Reflecting: this isn’t a diatribe against big companies. Space X is a big company. So is Tesla. And Amazon. It’s about what they _aspire_ to accomplish and how they measure success that matters. It’s the extra little details that show it’s about more than just hitting arbitrary success targets. Figuring out what it takes to build a culture that values going beyond to get it really right is really interesting.
