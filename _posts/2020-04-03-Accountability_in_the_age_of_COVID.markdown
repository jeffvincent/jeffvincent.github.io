Big ol’ caveat off the top - a lot of people lost their jobs as part of this pandemic, so this problem is certainly a nice problem to have.

But for those of us lucky enough to basically maintain "business as usual,” the problem remains: most of us just went fully remote for the first time ever, and fast. The fallout of this pandemic affects every single person on the team differently. Even for healthy businesses, the economic impacts of this are going to affect revenue plans, hiring, fundraising, etc.

In this new, chaotic environment, it's more important than ever we can rely on each other and ship _great_ work. That's not going to happen by accident, and it's not going to happen using the same processes as we used before, either.

**We need to start by talking about (and acknowledging) reality.** Revenues are going down, customers are potentially churning, things are preventing people from getting work done - this is an anxious time. Clearly calling out the real, tough problems makes them easier to dissect and solve. The safer a space we can make, the more people will be honest and transparent, and we can all breathe. That is going to lead to more aligned (and sane) decisions going forward.

**Communications need to happen _more_ regularly.** If we’re going to get aligned on what’s important, it needs to start with regular communications from as high up in leadership as you can get. There is a whole group of people who need to know what’s going on around the company (not just in their own sphere) to feel as if their experience is validated. Priorities need to change, goals need to shift, expectations need to be made clear. Consistent communication on what’s expected and updates on how the business is being affected day-to-day prevents the deafening silence of remote work from making you assume the worst. Quick add-on to this: "communications" doesn't have to mean long all-hands meetings or massive emails. Quick updates and daily check-ins keep everyone in the loop and feeling like a part of the team.

**Most of our processes and communication practices just got obsoleted.** This abrupt shift means we need to do more than just copy the practices of a “remote-first” company. We’ve got to start by cleaning out all the “old” processes (as in, what you did a month ago) that no longer work. Don’t be afraid to throw them away aggressively, you can always bring them back. But not all meetings translate seamlessly to Zoom, and we can’t rely on being near one another to share info either. Use this as an opportunity to find out what you really need to work together well and build upon that.

If we do all these things (and more), then we’ll get through this together. Add on to it an occasional non-work-related check-in with your co-workers, just to see how they are doing, and the communication lines will stay open. We can still work together (thank god for the internet) and we can still do great work (thank god for the internet x2). We have some initial hurdles to overcome, some tough realities to confront, and some processes to change - but we can do it.
