title: Momentum built on self esteem

Every week, at least once or twice, I get totally blindsided by a question.

After days obsessing over a project, someone will just wander into the room, take a look at it, and illuminate something totally new.

In my early career, that experience would have sent me _reeling_. I would go on the defensive - surely I had an answer for that. I couldn’t let them know I hadn’t considered that angle, delved into the details of that option, thought through that possibility before I began.

That feeling is certainly human - but it also didn’t help that often other leaders rewarded those who poked holes - to the point that people began searching for ways to take down other’s ideas.

At a particular low point, when it seemed I could move no good idea forward, I came upon a book that changed my life: “Self-Esteem at Work” by Nathaniel Branden.

The essence of the book: doing great creative work requires _risks_, and our workplaces must evolve to encourage and support the taking of those risks. Otherwise, we’ll always stick with what’s known: a surefire way to build something mediocre.

It changed my perspective, at work and at home, to identify what level of risk-taking we could get comfortable with, who could be in charge of taking those risks, what they needed to succeed, and how I could support them.

One change to try immediately: if a proposed idea is valuable and aligned with the goal, and is “safe to try”, meaning it can be reversed, the right thing to say is **”go for it”**. Don’t hedge, don’t separate yourself from the idea so you can be safe if the other person fails. Embrace the fact that they are taking a risk, acknowledge it’s possibility of failure, and then encourage them, with excitement, to give it a try.

Succeeding constantly is a myth. Every story of innovation and greatness involves failure, because failure is key to learning. Pair first principle thinking with “safe to try” encouragement and your organization will learn and move faster.
