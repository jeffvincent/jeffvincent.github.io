The recent interview processes brought up a number of good questions, specifically on _how I believe great products get built_. In my responses I started by working through how we did things at Appcues, but that process represented a compromise between how others wanted to do things and how I wanted to do things. While that is a useful exercise (makes sure I was paying attention) what would be more helpful is a clear, concise description of how _I_ would do things.

It will probably take several posts / attempts, but best to just get started with a high-level view.

"When a new business goal or objective is communicated, what do you do?"

### Guidelines
1. Get clear on the why.
2. I am a part of the team.
3. Introduce, then take action.
4. Leverage the skills of others.
5. Informed, not consensus.

### Artifacts
1. The opportunity doc: A thematic doc that moves from a high-level objective down into the key levers for improvement. This covers the goal, timeline, and plan of action (as it develops).
2. The roadmap item: A piece of work we've committed to. Ties back to the opportunity doc, but includes lots more research, iteration, and timing details.

### 01: why are we doing this?

The most important thing for me to understand is `why are we doing this`, and, relatedly, _why am I excited about doing this?_ The why needs to be in the context of our larger mission or reason for being - I'm a pretty mission-driven person and purpose is what motivates me, so "just because" or "to get paid" is never enough to generate energy.

Of course being excited isn't everything - but I can't effectively lead a team do to this work well unless I am fully committed and have a perspective on it. Sometimes my excitement is what we're going to be able to do _after_ we're done with this work - but still there must be some reason.

### 02: Introduce the opportunity

Once I understand the high-level why and have my perspective on it (why I'm excited to do it) I'm ready to have a team conversation on the topic. The first time a team hears about a new objective _from me_ it's critical that I don't communicate anything beyond 1. what's been from leadership and 2. my current perspective on it. If I'm coming to the table with lots of solutions or additional research, then I'm no longer in the mode to do lots of open-ended questioning - my mind is already on it's way to being made up. It also creates the feeling of me being separate from the team, like I kept this information from them.

Instead, at each step I share what I know so far, including my open questions, encourage the team to ask more open questions, identify possible action items or next steps, assign owners and deadlines, and then go take action.

So when we're first discussing the opportunity, it is very high-level. It is also accompanied by a doc that summarizes my understanding so far and links to all relevant resources (I've learned I can be more attentive to company communications / documentation than others). The goal isn't to jump to concrete solutions. The goal is to make sure everyone knows where we are now, what we need to know next, and can ask all questions. As soon as we're jumping past "the opportunity", questions like "why is this valuable for us to do?" get prematurely silenced. One thing I know about myself: when a leader says "jump" and I'm excited, I have a tendency to get right to it. Others on my team tend to be better at pushing back, and I can best leverage that by not being committed to any one solution.

`Sidenote:` at this stage I've probably had conversations with someone in "leadership" about possible solutions. And my mind might have already jumped to a few ideas. That is OK and normal - but I _cannot_ commit to those. If it's a worthwhile objective, then taking the time to discuss with the team is always the right move, will save SO MUCH time on the backend from having to convince others and bring them along for the ride. Not to mention ideas from teammates are often great and feeling shared ownership over the objective will spur them to action!

### 03: Opportunity agreement

Now that we've discussed the opportunity openly, it's time to refine that doc, narrow it in, and make some top-level commitments. For example: the team might have identified holes in the problem statement provided by me / leadership. Or we might have discussed other important work that would need to be prioritized alongside any work proposed for this objective (this happens constantly).

The _best_ next move is to update the doc to reflect what was discussed so far, and send it to everyone involved. Send it to the team for review, send it to "leadership" (whatever that means in this case) for input. It is worth the extra time at this stage to make sure everyone is aligned. Better to push for alignment and proper prioritization of the *opportunity* than *the solution*. Avoids a ton of back-and-forth and "backseat driving".

**That doc should contain:**

- statement of the opportunity
- what problem does this solve?
- who are we targeting?
- how does this relate to our mission?
- how will we measure success?
- what other constraints exist?
- what is the timeline?
- when do we plan to begin this work?
- what are our open questions?

### 04: Zoom in on the key lever

Once the opportunity is well defined and agreed upon, we can zoom in a level, and follow an "opportunity tree" to see what the possible levers for focus are. The goal for this step is to narrow in on a specific problem area, and to give everyone else involved a chance to understand why you're going in that direction.

By opportunity tree, I mean: for any given problem of sufficient size, there are several different ways to approach it. `Increasing retention` for example, can be accomplished by "increasing value customers receive" and "decreasing the price they pay", among other levers. Each of those options can be broken down further into _their_ components, etc. We're trying to get as refined on the problem to focus on as possible, without jumping to solutions.

The challenge in this step is evaluating each of those possible levers and identifying which ones you'll choose - without requiring an _overly_ long writeup or endless back-and-forth. These are mostly reversible decisions, and many "branches" of the tree will be somewhat close in possible value. This is a good opportunity to look for "two birds one stone" type wins: places where your teams focus might improve other aspects of the business or future objectives, etc.

Once the key levers have been identified, the problem statements for each can be added to the opportunity doc. This is a good opportunity to check back in with the team. Choosing a set of key levers usually requires a good amount of thinking, discovery, and learning - so there should be new information to share. This is a chance to get everyone caught up at a much more actionable state - again without jumping into solutions, which will get designers and engineers whirring away from the problem itself. We're still trying to make sure we're choosing the **best possible problem** to focus on.

The final decision to be made at this step is which lever you will focus on first. Getting input from everyone is critical (you'll do that by having your opportunity doc clear, updated, and shared as widely as possible) - but the final decision rests with the PM.

Once that final lever is chosen, set up a number of baseline metrics, getting several different perspectives on the current case. You don't need to set _goals_ for those metrics yet, because don't have the baseline! But if you can be gathering data at this stage, it will save you a ton of time and make you more educated as you go along.

### 05: Dig in with customer conversations

Note: steps 4, 5, and 6 don't always happen in a linear fashion. In particular, research and solutioning can end up overlapping quite a bit as new things are learned. The important takeaway is: some open-ended discussions with your customers about the specific problem you've focused on are _extremely_ valuable before anchoring on a given solution.

My preference is to practice "continuous interviewing", where the product team is talking to customers in a more open-ended way on a weekly/bi-weekly cadence. Setting up a system where you have customers to talk to constantly without strict agenda makes you more aware of what `their real problems are`, as opposed to being driven by what _your_ agenda is at any given time. That's a good thing. I should write more about that topic separately.

A good outcome for this step is being a bit more informed or validated in your hypotheses, and having some more customer artifacts (emails, screenshots, etc.) that you can add to the opportunity doc. Teammates really value having more real-world context in the customer's own voice.

### 06: Diverge, then converge

Now we can be pretty confident we've evaluated the space _together_ (even if the PM/research/design did most of the digging, everyone is informed and had a say). This is really important to me especially, because I'm terrible at just executing on someone else's ideas. If I don't feel bought in, then I'm not bringing my absolute top abilities to the table. So I guess I apply that to others too.

The next step generally follows the "shaping" idea introduced by Ryan Singer of Basecamp: based on our budget (what this is worth to us), what could an ideal solution include and _generally_ look like? Collaborative design exercises (like Crazy Eights) are very useful here: we've done some research and discussed the problem/opportunity and made it clear, now let's get sketching!

Sketching is valuable - but the more important part is the discussion _afterward_: why did you go in that direction? What were you optimizing for? This process can open your mind up to all kinds of potential directions. I need this because I can (without even meaning to) jump to an initial solution, and from there it's just some gradations from the mean, as opposed to totally different options.

A FAQ: what if people don't _want_ to be part of the previous steps? I'm somewhat flexible on that - I can understand that some people don't want to be in the discussions or do the research - they just want to focus on the execution because it's what they LOVE :heart:. I can respect that - but ask they read and dig into the opportunity doc. Otherwise, they will be uninformed in making all the little choices as part of execution that make the end product more successful. There are things that only become clear as the code gets written - and having an understanding of what we're trying to achieve will allow us to make decisions on those much faster and with more autonomy.

### 07: Select, and execute

No need to get into what "execution" looks like in this post, IMO. Depending on the initiative it could be running experiments, updating existing features, refactoring back-end code, launching new features into beta, etc. What's most important is you clearly select the solution(s) you're going with first, set success criteria for those, and start working out the potential implications. And as [Kevin Kelly suggests](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/), set a deadline. It will force you to make hard decisions much earlier.

### 08: Get data early

When I was at Wistia we launched a massive marketing campaign. After a whole bunch of spreadsheets and "market research", we started putting creative out there across a number of different channels. It cost a lot of money. The results weren't expected to hit for months. That seems like way too long. If something isn't causing change in the short term, it isn't going to cause change in the long-term. The short-term could be small, of course - but few things go from flat-line to massive growth overnight.

The same applies here: set your milestones before you launch something, so you know if you're on track to start moving the success metrics your objective rests on (which tend to be backwards looking and take time to accumulate). If you know what you're looking out for, and have those baseline metrics in place, you're in a better position to have a conversation immediately: what's going well, what's not going well. `Have a _hypothesis_ about what will happen in the short-term`. Even if you're wrong, that will mean you can learn something. And if you're right - you should still dig in. Richard Feynman mentions the rats finding cheese experiment he heard about - where it seemed like the rats were going into the same room in a maze again and again. Easy to assume it was where the cheese was hidden. Turns out (I'm absolutely butchering this story in the paraphrasing) it was the creak in the floorboards outside that particular door in the maze. Even when you're successful: dig in and understand your success. That will make you confident you've actually learned something!
