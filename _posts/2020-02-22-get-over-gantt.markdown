I find myself flipping back and forth from trying to be a “traditional Product Manager” and being myself.

I hate letting people down. More extreme than that - I am driven by a desire to impress. It shows I left a mark in some way - people’s minds were changed by what I said. At least, that’s how I think of it.

So when the people around me, especially those with power and authority, have expectations of a certain behavior - I can feel a gravity pulling me in that direction.

My worst fear (at work) is being unprepared. Not having the answers, not thinking through the scenarios, losing people’s trust. The obsessive thinking that fear drives collides with my natural (overly) trusting tendencies - I am lucky to generally see the world as a safe place where things work out. I have no expectations, I am at peace and accepting of myself.

So I find myself in a constant tug of war. A flipping back and forth between a calm, focused creator, spending a lot of time in future thinking mode, or writing code) and an obsessive detail monger, writing documents, organizing spreadsheets, reviewing each and every detail to ensure by the time it’s shared, it’s perfect. No chance of let down.

When I wrote the title for this post, I thought I knew the answer: release the inner creator. Just go and make something. And I suppose that is good advice, in a way. But it’s not quite what I believe, when I work through it.

But building a product is a team sport. There are other people involved, who also want to bring their creative energy to the table.

What I believe: there’s a good balance here. A way to think deeply, reduce the risks that are important, communicate well, nail the details - without excluding others. Without losing the focus on creating something for someone to use and find delight in. Without losing the fun that is learning as you go alongside others.

It’s about what you seek to control. I need to let go of the interest in being impressive in all eyes. In fact, to some I might seem to be unimpressive. They want something perfectly buttoned up - delivered on-time and on-budget. That has it’s merits - but when that is focus above having an impact on the user and on the product … it’s worthless. Sorry.
