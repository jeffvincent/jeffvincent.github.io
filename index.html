  <h1>hi :)</h1>

  <p>
    Writing helps clarify my thoughts. Clearer thoughts make for better actions,
    which means more impact, better relationships, more success.
  </p>

  <p>
    Writing in public ... is hard. I put a lot of pressure on things I show others -
    nitpicking and editing forever. My thoughts get clearer, but I never actually
    <strong>publish anything</strong>.
    Maybe this is a form of <i>less</i> public writing I could try.
  </p>

  <p>
    Some of these posts are evergreen, and will get updated whenever I learn something new. I hope you enjoy.
